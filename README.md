Repository for holding Module 3 classwork code

## Project Overview

A Colorado Board of Elections employee, Tom, has given me the following tasks to complete the election audit for a local congressional election - so that the election results can be certified. 

1) Calculate the total number of votes cast. 
2) Get a complete list of candidates who received votes. 
3) Calculate the total number of votes and percentage received for each candidate
4) Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
5) Provide this election_analysis in a printable report and as a text data file. 

## Resources Used for Election Analysis
- Data Source: election_results.csv (provided by Colorado Board of Elections Employee - Tom.
